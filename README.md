# Reliability - Python Library - Exercises

#Python #Reliabity #Maintenance

Welcome to this repository of practice exercises for the Python reliability library!   
Here you'll find a series of problems and examples to help you familiarize yourself with the features of this powerful library for reliability analysis and life engineering.   

### About the Reliability Library
The Reliability Library is an open-source tool for Python that provides a wide range of functions for reliability analysis. It allows you to perform:

- Life data analysis: Distribution fitting (Weibull, exponential, lognormal, etc.), parameter estimation, probability plots.
- Systems analysis: Reliability of series, parallel, and k-of-n systems.
- Warranty data analysis: Failure prediction, warranty tracking.
- Accelerated testing: Modeling accelerated test data.
- And much more.
- 
It is an invaluable tool for reliability engineers, data scientists, and anyone working with life and failure data.
